I feel confident and excited to take the next step in my career path. The Bootcamp has given me not only technical skills but also the mindset to keep learning and improving.

During the Bootcamp, I gained solid hands-on experience with full-stack development, especially in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I learned how to build responsive web apps, manage state using Redux Toolkit, and implement authentication and backend APIs. These skills have helped me understand real-world development workflows and improved my ability to build scalable, maintainable applications.

Aside from the technical side, Iâ€™ve also grown in terms of time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. Working on projects and debugging code taught me how to stay calm under pressure and find solutions step by step.

Overall, I feel ready to start applying for roles, contribute to real-world projects, and keep leveling up my skills. I'm especially interested in frontend or full-stack roles where I can continue to grow and create meaningful products.
